What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is the field of study that deals with making computers "learn" from data/experience.

Main Use Cases

Machine Learning is mainly useful in cases where:

there is no human expertise available to solve a problem
there is human expertise, but humans cannot explain the expertise well enough (if at all) to be able to hard-code a program
the solution changes with time
a customized solution is required, ex. targeted marketing/advertising
How is Machine Learning Getting Better?

Advances in ML are mainly owed to:

the increased amounts of data
the development of better algorithms
the availability of cheap and more powerful computing resources
